# HTTP Socket Project using Winsock2

This repository implements a simple HTTP server and client using Winsock2 on Windows. Both the server and client are built using CMake, and they demonstrate basic TCP/IP communication over HTTP.


## Features
- **HTTP Server**: Listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with a simple HTML message.
- **HTTP Client**: Sends HTTP GET requests to the server and displays the response.
- **Winsock2**: Utilizes the Windows Sockets API for network communication.
- **CMake**: Builds the project with cross-platform compatibility in mind.
- **Makefiles**: Simple build automation.
